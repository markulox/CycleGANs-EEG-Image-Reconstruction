**Update**
This project has been cancelled due to a low feasibility. 
-----
These code are using cycle gans framework to do an image reconstruction from EEG signal. We use a wavelet nearal networks layer in our feature extractor parts. We hope that these can improve the image generation quality or model performance. We soon will provide our dataset in to this repository, or we might put an external link to our custom dataset.
